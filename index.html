        <p id="tribute-info"> American agronomist Norman Ernest Borlaug (March 25, 1914 â€“ September 12, 2009) oversaw programs that aided in the Green Revolution's massive increases in agricultural output. He created semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat cultivars and taught Mexico, Pakistan, and India how to use contemporary agricultural production methods. For his contributions, he received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
